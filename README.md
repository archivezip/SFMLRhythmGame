# SFMLRhythmGame
A IIDX / Mania / Quaver styled 2D rhythm game developed in C++/SFML. (for now)
Plans are to move to FMOD Audio and potentially ditch SFML entirely.

The idea of the project is to challenge myself to make a clone game similarly to quaver, and give my own SDVX 'effecting' style to the genre.
It would be cool to do hit/keysounds, which would be entirely possible as the game's music will be entirely composed of my friends music.

The themeing of the game is still being decided, do not want to settle on anything until the first prototype is completed.
